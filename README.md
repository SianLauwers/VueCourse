My name is Sian Lauwers, for the course Professional Skills 3 I had to choose a course regarding programming and technology to take this opportunity to learn something new. I chose to study VueJS because I always wanted to learn this framework and this was a great timing. I finished the course on 10/02/2024. There are multiple folders in here such as: Complete, Starter, and zip.
In the beginning of the course we had to download all of the course material and in here were the zip files which I placed in the zip folder of my repository. In these zip files there were folders with the completed exercises and the starter files. This was great to have because multiple times in the course videos the lecturer was using a lot of things from vue 2.
This was really confusing at first especially when you had to go and debug yourself. The course itself was a 3.5/5 in my opinion. I would have loved to see more about the composition API and there were a lot of mistakes in the course which I had to figure out myself afterwards. Although this was a learning experience, it took a lot of my time and patience.

I will definetily look up more about the composition API because for 90% of this course we used the options API of Vue and I think the composition API might be more useful for reusability.

We had to create a masters project, I finished this in Section 20 if you want to see it for yourself. Don't forget to run the npm install and npm run dev command.
